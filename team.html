                            <h4>Important Update: Loss of Past Exhibition Records</h4>
                            <br/>
                            <p>We regret to inform you that during the restoration process, 
                                we discovered a regrettable incident—a loss of records containing valuable information about our past exhibitions.
                                We understand the disappointment this may cause to our dedicated patrons and researchers who have relied on these records.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>However, we want to assure you that our team is committed to rebuilding and recovering the lost information. 
                                We will work tirelessly to reconstruct the exhibition histories, collaborating with experts, 
                                former curators, and community members to gather as much data as possible. 
                                This incident has motivated us to implement enhanced archival practices and 
                                preservation methods to safeguard our future records.
                            </p>

                                We will forge ahead, drawing strength from the knowledge that the stories within our walls 
                                are much more than mere records—they are etched in the memories of our community, 
                                passed down through generations, and woven into the very fabric of our identity.
